# File-Copier-in-Java

In this program we will see how we can create file copy program which works exactly like windows file copy mechanism with functionalities described as below.

* It will ask user for inputpath name, OutputPathname and file name which needs to be copied.If input file exist then it will copy that file into new file name with exact conventions followed by windows. (i.e. “- Copy”, “- Copy (2)” etc.)
